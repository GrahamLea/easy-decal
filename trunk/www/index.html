   <p>
      you are in the right place.

   <h3>Source Code</h3>

   <p>
      Why would you want to look at the source code?
      Well, there is some interesting code in there.
      There's an implementation of octree colour quantisation (or color quantization, depending
      on your dictionary).
      There's also a mostly-complete Java API for writing Half-Life WAD files
      (but not for reading them - well, not yet, anyway).
      It would probably also be a good, small application for someone starting with Swing to study
      to see examples of how to use simple components, GUI Commands, Foxtrot, CardLayout and the
      JDIC Desktop component.
   </p>

   <p>
      Anyway, you can get instructions for accessing the source code, or even browse it online,
      by following the 'Version Control' link on the left.
