<h3>Answers</h3>

<a name="what">
<h4>So, what does it do?</h4>

<p>
In Half-Life, Counter-Strike, and other games based on the Half-Life engine,
players can have their own "decal" or "spray", which is an image or logo that
they can spray paint onto walls.<br>
Easy Decal allows you to create your own decal from almost any image in a couple of seconds.
</p>


<a name="wally">
<h4>Doesn't Wally already do this?</h4>

<p>
Yes, and no.
</p>
<p>
The Half-Life engine places certain restrictions on decals; they must have
dimensions that are factors of 16, must be smaller than a particular total area,
and must have a 256-colour palette.<br>

<a href="http://www.telefragged.com/wally/" target="_blank">Wally</a>
requires your image to meet all these requirements before it can make
a decal out of it. If you don't know how to use an image manipulation program or
don't understand the requirements, it can be a pretty trying experience to make
your own decal. Even if you do, it's still not an easy task.<br>
</p>

<p>
Easy Decal, on the other hand, allows you to turn almost ANY image into a decal,
no matter what size it is or how many colours it contains. Easy Decal
automatically handles the conversion of your image into one that meets the
requirements of the Half-Life engine.<br>

All you have to do is drag and drop.
</p>


<a name="download">
<h4>So, I just download Easy Decal and run it?</h4>

<p>
Easy Decal is written in Java and will require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
in order to run.
</p>


<a name="doihavejava">
<h4>How do I tell if I have Java installed?</h4>

<p>
The easiest way is to open a command prompt (cmd.exe in Windows) or a shell and type 'java -version'
(without the quotes). If Java is installed, it should run and print the version.<br>
If you are told that Java is not a recognised command, you probably don't have Java installed (but
you might).<br>
Following the instructions to <a href="#jre">install Java</a> will tell you whether or not you do.
</p>


<a name="javaversion">
<h4>What Java version does it need?</h4>

<p>Easy Decal requires Java version 1.4.2 or higher.</p>


<a name="jre">
<h4>Where can I download a Java Runtime Environemt (JRE)?</h4>

<p>The easiest way to download a Java Runtime Environment is by going to:<pre>
   <a href="http://java.com/" target="_blank">http://java.com/</a>
</pre>
and clicking the 'Get It Now' button at the top</p>

<p>Currently (2004/12/04), this method will install Java 1.4.2_06.</p>

<p>
To download a Java version 5.0 JRE, you will need to go to:<pre>
   <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp" target="_blank">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/download.jsp</a>
</pre>
and follow the "Download JRE" link.
</p>


<a name="formats">
<h4>What image formats does Easy Decal accept?</h4>

<p>Easy Decal will read whatever image formats your Java installation is capable of
reading.</p>

<p>If you have Java 1.4 installed, Easy Decal will read JPEG, GIF and PNG files.<br>
If you have Java 5.0 installed, it will also read BMP files.</p>


<a name="otherformats">
<h4>What if my image is in another format?</h4>

<p>
You could do one of two things. You could search for and install a Java ImageIO
plugin for your image's type, or you could convert your image to one of the accepted
formats using an image program like The GIMP (see below).<br>
I recommend the second option.
</p>


<a name="createimage">
<h4>How do I make an image to begin with?</h4>

<p>I recommend The GIMP as best value for money. It's free!</p>


<a name="gimp">
<h4>What is The GIMP?</h4>

<p>
The GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.<br>
It is essentially a Photoshop clone. It has *heaps* of features, but is not
quite as easy to use as Photoshop, but still very good.
</p>

<p>
The GIMP website is:<pre>
   <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">http://www.gimp.org/</a>
</pre>
It's easiest to download a Windows version from:<pre>
   <a href="http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://gimp-win.sourceforge.net/</a>
</pre>
</p>


<a name="bug">
<h4>I think I found a bug. What do I do?</h4>

<p>There are instructions about submitting bug reports in the README.txt file.</p>
