CONTACT

 - Reporting Bugs -

If you find a bug in Easy Decal, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure it is a bug! (READ THIS!)
   The majority of error messages output by Easy Decal DO NOT indicate bugs in the application.
   Messages such as "Your Java version is not capable of reading this type of image." and
   "Failure while reading image file" probably indicate a problem with your image rather than with
   the program.
   Try converting your image to a different format (BMP <-> JPG <-> PNG <-> etc) and trying again.
   Take special note that Easy Decal only works with Java 1.4.2 and above. (Note the .2 !!)

2. Try to figure out something about the bug yourself.
   Does it only occur with a certain type of file?
   Does it occur with files created by a certain application but not with those created by others?
   Does it work if you make the source image larger or smaller?

3. Send an email, with the subject "Easy Decal BUG", to:

      issues@easy-decal.dev.java.net

   Include in this email the WHOLE output of Easy Decal (including the Java version at the top).
   DO NOT send your image in the email. If I require your image to diagnose the problem I will ask
   you to send it to me.
   Please include this in the email everything you discovered about the bug in step 2.
