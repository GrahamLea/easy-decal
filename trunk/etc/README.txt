REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT!)

To run Easy Decal, you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
The version must be 1.4.2 or above.
Version 1.4.1 WILL NOT WORK.

Download Java now   @   http://java.com/


INSTALLATION - EasyDecal_Setup.exe

If you donwloaded the installer and you're reading this, you've probably already run it, which is
all you needed to do.

INSTALLATION - EasyDecal.zip

If you donwloaded the ZIP, simply unzip it straight into Program Files, making sure the
'Use Folder Names' option is on.


USAGE

Easy Decal can be run either by:

   1) Double-clicking the Easy Decal icon, which opens the Easy Decal GUI; or

   2) Dragging an image or images and dropping them onto the Easy Decal icon.
      This will create decals from those images without opening the GUI.

More information about creating decals with Easy Decal can be found in doc/Create_Decals.html

Information about how to install decals can be found in doc/Install_Decals.html

Some parameters controlling the behaviour of Easy Decal can be changed through the easy-decal.cfg
file. Documentation about the parameters can be found in that file.


INTERNATIONALISATION

Easy Decal should automatically display in English, French, German or Spanish, depending on the
locale settings on your computer.

be made to the existing translations, please send an email to:

MAKE A DONATION

Easy Decal is FREE.
You can download it and run it without paying a cent.
It has no limitations and no "trial period".

However, it took me a lot of time to create.
If you use and like Easy Decal, I'd really appreciate it if you make a small donation.

FUTURE FEATURES

While there is currently no plan to make any improvements to Easy Decal, there are some very useful
features (e.g. installing decals) which, if there is sufficient interest, I might be inspired to
implement. See the Donate link above for more information. ;)


CONTACT

 - Reporting Bugs -

If you find a bug in Easy Decal, please follow these steps:

1. Make sure it is a bug! (READ THIS!)
   The majority of error messages output by Easy Decal DO NOT indicate bugs in the application.
   Messages such as "Your Java version is not capable of reading this type of image." and
   "Failure while reading image file" probably indicate a problem with your image rather than with
   the program.
   Try converting your image to a different format (BMP <-> JPG <-> PNG <-> etc) and trying again.
   Take special note that Easy Decal only works with Java 1.4.2 and above. (Note the .2 !!)

2. Try to figure out something about the bug yourself.
   Does it only occur with a certain type of file?
   Does it occur with files created by a certain application but not with those created by others?
   Does it work if you make the source image larger or smaller?

3. Send an email, with the subject "Easy Decal BUG", to:

      issues@easy-decal.dev.java.net

   Include in this email the WHOLE output of Easy Decal (including the Java version at the top).
   DO NOT send your image in the email. If I require your image to diagnose the problem I will ask
   you to send it to me.
   Please include this in the email everything you discovered about the bug in step 2.
