      <small>
         <b>*</b> The current version of Easy Decal does not install sprays into your games for
         you, but easy-to-follow instructions are included.<br>
         The next major upgrade of Easy Decal will be able to install your decals automatically.

         <b>**</b> Easy Decal can read any image format that Java can read.<br>
         This includes JPG, GIF, PNG and, if you have Java 5 installed, BMP and WBMP.<br>
         The Java Image I/O library can also be extended with plugins to read other formats.
