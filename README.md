# Easy Decal

Easy Decal is a utility/wizard that I wrote in 2004/2005 that's used to create custom "decals" for Counter-Strike
and other games that run on the original Half-Life engine.

## Why did I build it?

At the time, the only other way to create such decals was to follow complicated tutorials that detailed how to
* scale and crop an image to the correct size (x and y must both be a multiple of 16, no greater than 256, with a total 
area no greater than 10,752!),
* convert the colour model to a 256-colour pallette,
* then somehow convert the output into a WAD file.

## Did anyone use it?

Easy Decal was amazingly popular - as in, thousands and thousands of downloads over many months.
Despite having a 'Donate' button in the wizard, I only ever received one donation, which turned out to be a mistake.
I consider it one of my biggest entrepreneurial mistakes that I never considered better monetisation strategies
for Easy Decal, and intead gave away for free a popular niche tool for a very big market.
