<h1>Installing Decals</h1>

<p>To install a Decal into Half-Life, Counter-Strike or any other HL-engine-based game, you need to copy the generated
WAD file to within your game or mod directory and rename it.<br>
Where to copy it and what to name it depends on your how you're running Half-Life:</p>

<p>To find out how to create a decal with Easy Decal, see <a href="Create_Decals.html">Creating Decals with Easy Decal</a>.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

This is a summary of where files should be copied and what they should be renamed to.<br>
For further information see the detail explanations below.

<h3>Steam</h3>

Copy to:<pre>
   &lt;Steam_Install_Dir&gt; \ SteamApps \ &lt;Steam_ID&gt; \ &lt;Game_Dir&gt; \ &lt;Game_Abrreviation_Dir&gt;</pre>
Rename to:<pre>
   tempdecal.wad</pre>
Example:<pre>
   C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\bbgun\counter-strike\cstrike\tempdecal.wad</pre>

<h3>Without Steam</h3>

Copy to:<pre>
   &lt;Game_Install_Dir&gt; \ &lt;Game_Abrreviation_Dir&gt;</pre>
Rename to:<pre>
   pldecal.wad</pre>
Example:<pre>
   C:\Program Files\Half-Life\cstrike\pldecal.wad</pre>


<h2>Steam</h2>

<h3>Copy the WAD</h3>

<p>If you're running your games using Steam, you need to copy your decal WAD file to:<pre>
   &lt;Steam_Install_Dir&gt; \ SteamApps \ &lt;Steam_ID&gt; \ &lt;Game_Dir&gt; \ &lt;Game_Abrreviation_Dir&gt;</pre>

where:<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Steam_Install_Dir&gt;</code><br>
   is the directory where Steam is installed (e.g. C:\Program Files\Steam)<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Steam_ID&gt;</code><br>
   is your Steam ID (there will probably only be one directory under SteamApps/)<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Game_Dir&gt;</code><br>
   is the directory containing the game or mod to which you want to add the decal (e.g. "counter-strike", "half-life"
   or "team fortress classic")<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Game_Abbreviation_Dir&gt;</code><br>
   is the directory inside Game_Dir that is an abreviation of the game's or mod's name (e.g. "cstrike", "half-life"
   or "tfc")<br><br>
</p>

<p>As an example, for Billy Bob Gunn (whose steam ID is 'bbgun') to install a decal into Counter-Strike, he would copy
it into:<pre>
   C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\bbgun\counter-strike\cstrike\</pre>

Note that you need to copy the decal into the directory of each game or mod in which you want to use it.</p>


<h3>Rename the WAD</h3>

<p>You then need to delete the file called <code>tempdecal.wad</code> (if one exists) and rename your decal's WAD
file to <code>tempdecal.wad</code>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, at this point, you make the file read-only.<br>
This is because every time you change your Steam settings (video, audio, multi-player name, etc.), Steam will overwrite
this file with whatever standard decal is selected in the options.<br>
If the file is read-only, Steam (usually) won't overwrite it.</p>




<h2>Half-Life / Counter-Strike<br>
<font size="-1">(Store bought)</font></h2>

<h3>Copy the WAD</h3>

<p>If you're running your games using a Half-Life engine that you bought at a store (hopefully) in a Half-Life or
Counter-Strike box, and you don't use Steam, you should copy your decal WAD file to:<pre>
   &lt;Game_Install_Dir&gt; \ &lt;Game_Abrreviation_Dir&gt;</pre>

where:<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Game_Install_Dir&gt;</code><br>
   is the directory where your installed the game (e.g. C:\Program Files\Half-Life)<br><br>

   <code>&lt;Game_Abbreviation_Dir&gt;</code><br>
   is the directory inside Game_Install_Dir that is an abreviation of the name of the game or mod to which you want to
   add the decal (e.g. "cstrike", "half-life" or "tfc")
   <br><br>
</p>

<p>As an example, if Billy bought Half-Life and then installed Counter-Strike 1.5 into it, he would copy his decal into:
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Half-Life\cstrike\</pre>

Note that you need to copy the decal into the directory of each game or mod in which you want to use it.</p>

<h3>Rename the WAD</h3>

<p>You then need to delete the file called <code>pldecal.wad</code> (if one exists) and rename your decal's WAD
file to <code>pldecal.wad</code>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that, at this point, you make the file read-only.<br>
This is because every time you change your game settings (video, audio, multi-player name, etc.), the game will
overwrite this file with whatever standard decal is selected in the options.<br>
If the file is read-only, it (usually) won't overwrite it.</p>
